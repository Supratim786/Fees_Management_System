# Fees_Management_System
The Fees Management System is a core Java project that deals with the crucial process of collecting the college/institution fees of the student, maintains all student record, search and generate the record in form of excel and also keeps a check on the fines if applicable. Thus, making the system reliable for the college accounts department.

There is nothing to deny that fee management is one of the most important tasks that are done by a school on a regular basis. It is with the help of such work that a school is able to keep complete track of the fees that the students are paying. There was a time when such systems were pretty critical and there were plenty of errors involved in such work as well. This primarily boiled down to the fact that it was done in a manual way.
These are integrated systems that we are talking about over here. At a very basic level, they help you collect fees, search records and generate and maintain reports. All this implies that the management becomes free of any trouble, a lot more convenient, and free of paper as well.
In this Fees Management System, fees collection and management are crucial processes for the schools/colleges or any institution. In this system we aim to provide the user to easily handle things like:
  1. Adding the Fees.
  2. Searching Records which also helps in identifying the fees defaulters.
  3. Maintaining the whole record of a student.

In short, it simplifies day to day task in fee and bill payment and makes it easier irrespective of which task a person is handling.

If a person is using the best student management system, he/she will get an integrated fee management system. It gives them the facility to set up a complete fee structure according to student category, course or service requirement. The system also gives the power to collect a late payment, fines and provide required function as well.
The broad scope of the Fees Management System (FMS) project includes:
1. The system will be available for 24x7 accesses to the administration department.
2. The system will provide all the fees structure of all the available courses.
3. The system as a function of calculating the fine required to be paid by the student during his fees submission.
4. The system has the ability to send confirmation emails to the registered student emails once their fees are being added successfully.
5. The system is very much beneficial in generating the report of students who have paid their fees and also identify the fees defaulter student.
6. The system is capable of maintaining all the past records of the student.
